This branch SAYS it's stable but it's probably lying to you. 
Good luck soldier.

Instructions: 

Option A) If you want to play with the level then just open it in unity and have fun with the depriciated stuff. 

Option B) If you just want to play/break the game, unzip the file in the Builds folder and give it a go. 
If it doesn't work, see Option A.
